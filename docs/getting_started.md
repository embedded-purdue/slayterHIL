# Getting Started on SlayterHIL

Welcome to **SlayterHIL** ðŸ‘‹  

This document details what is needed to get started developing on SlayterHIL and the goals of the first workday.


## By end of today you should

- Know if you are a good fit for this team
- Have a subteam with an established leader
- Have pushed to this repo
- Know what tech you are going to be working on
- Start working on your subsystem requirements

## Subteams and their projects




## Things members should know well ASAP

Everyone
- Git. You must do all your work in your own branch, then merge to main when it is complete + tested. No committing to main.

Firmware team
- C programming. This is non-negotiable since the hardset part will be using the RTOS. If you are unsure if your skills are up to par, here are some leetcode problems you should be able to do in C reseasonbly quickly
    - https://leetcode.com/problems/design-circular-queue/
    - https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/
    - https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string
- Zephyr RTOS. Experience is not required, but having a good handle of it is a handy skill (I talk about it in nearly every interview). To get better, I would recommend [this playlist](https://youtu.be/mTJ_vKlMS_4?si=MCWa-z2xnW9vRS_Q) from Digikey. It is well laid out and how I learned!

Hardware team
- PCB design using KiCAD. See workshop from Tim on first workday

Flight simulation
- General programming. Not sure what your stack will look like yet; most likely C++.


Test automation
- Python programming. Tests will be defined using pytest


## Deliverable for next week

- Subsystem requirements: what is your system supposed to do?
- Subsystem black boxes: how are you going to separate the work?
- Tickets: Who is going do to what work?
